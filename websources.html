                My first Sources come from the bureau of justice statistics it it data sets that focuss of corrections and different moratility statitics. here's a link. this source is very reliable because it is the number 1 government source for criminal data. I used 3 datasets from them for my exploratory data analysis<a href="https://www.bjs.gov/index.cfm?ty=tp&tid=19"> BJS</a
            </li>
